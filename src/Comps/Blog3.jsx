                para="Pro: With never-ending new developments, web developers (and starting professionals alike) can enjoy a thriving industry of boundless opportunities. Web technologies continue to advance at a swift pace, yielding innovations such as the “progressive web apps” (PWAs) of recent years, the use of artificial intelligence, and voice search optimisation. These new trends and practices bode fresh roles and specialties for those in the industry to explore or progress to.

                Additionally, these rising opportunities lend to the industry’s growth as a whole; with employment in the field expected to grow by 25% in the next five years (according to SEEK). Web developers can therefore enjoy plenty of job security, as well options to shift gears to varying sectors, if desired.."

                para2="Con: Though the hours can depend from one web development job to another, those in the field may work long hours to successfully deliver projects within a tight deadline. Clients may even request changes on a whim, or additional features without providing extensions. You might find yourself working weekends and late nights with little to no compensation.

                ."
                para3="Pro: As an issue stereotypical of the tech industry, plenty have made their voices heard regarding critical work-life balance concerns. These have made it to the forefront of current tech discourse, as employees find themselves leaving their current jobs for healthier, more fulfilling career paths as part of the impending “Great Resignation”.
                As a result, businesses are pushed to consider ways of ensuring greater work-life balance and flexibility, with work-from-home and hybrid work options likely to stay. Since much of a web developer’s work is done online or on the computer, there are endless remote opportunities available – giving you the freedom of working when and where you please.
                
                On top of that, web developers currently earn an attractive average annual salary of $102,557 AUD, with the opportunity to earn even more as experience grows."
                para4="Con: Web developers typically spend the entire work day in front of a screen, which may make certain tasks feel tedious or repetitive. You won’t always be working on a life-changing app or the next billion-dollar social media platform; sometimes your workload may be as simple as fixing bugs and maintaining old code."
