Nuphy Halo65 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard'
                para="Nuphy's Halo65 is a mechanical wireless keyboard that's fairly compact and great to use, but its small size is countered by its premium pricing."

                para2="Wireless keyboards usually have a simple and light design that only offers a basic typing experience to you, but Nuphy takes that a step or two further with different colorful backlit keyboard modes and mechanical keys in its Halo65 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard."
                para3="The keyboard ships with replacement keys of different colors ranging from yellow to red, to white, and a USB-C to USB-A charging wire to either use the keyboard in Wired Mode or charge it after using it in Wireless mode. It also includes a tool to take off the keys when switching them out."
                para4="There are multiple wireless keyboards to choose from on the market. But if you are looking for a good mechanical one that offers a large range of customization options from the backlit colors shown to the outer design, then the Halo65 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard may interest you."
